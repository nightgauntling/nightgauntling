- I'm Theo Perth, or @nightgauntling

- I work in applications and testing with RF and IR transmitters, and we have an audio server that requires network troubleshooting via SSH at times. 
- I've been working on learning some methods of automating testing on our mobile applications for my department. 
- That means I'm trying to upgrade from very basic programming knowledge to functional skills.
- Currently working with SSH (of course), SQL, and Python. Going to work with some JavaScript, reluctantly. 
- 
- For fun projects, I'll be working on some basic baby programmer stuff, text adventures, apps for manipulating BT audio, or similar. 
- 
- I've also started the groundwork for a database of objective and subjective data about art and entertainment called CULTure. 
- I'd like it to be useful for anthropological data as well as neural networking in the future. 
- For now, I'll be boning up on PHP, SQL, Python, and more by exploring Wikimedia a bit.
- Or maybe I just wanted to start a project called cult, because being a cult leader sounds like a cushy job.
